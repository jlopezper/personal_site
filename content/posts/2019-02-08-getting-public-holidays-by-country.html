<p>I’ve been recently working on a time series model to which I wanted to include the public holidays of Spain and Portugal. After trying different approaches I decided to move forward with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/"><code>prophet</code></a> which, by the way, I strongly recommend it.</p>
<p>But this post comes to my mind because I’d like to tell some options we have to get the public holidays by country. I don’t want to go into details about the specificities of what a public holidays mean (regional or local ones are excluded in this analysis, for example).</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to search for an existing R package and I couldn’t find anything. As a colleague pointed me this package would likely suffer from a strong maintenance. However, as <code>prophet</code> has a built-in function to include holidays, I considered to look into the code and I found that the package provides a data.frame with the holidays from 1995 to 2044 for many countries (there are around 100 different country names but I think half of them are country codes).</p>
<p>For many purposes this dataframe would suffice but it’s weird for me to load <code>prophet</code> just for taking advantage of this data. So I decided to keep exploring and I found <a href="https://holidayapi.com/">holidayapi.com</a> which provides an API to access the data but I realized that the free account is limited so I didn’t deepen here.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="https://date.nager.at/">date.nager.at</a> provides the same information but also an open <a href="https://date.nager.at/Home/Api">API</a> so with the following simple function we can access to the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(httr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)

get_holidays &lt;- function(country_code, year) {
  # Build URL
  url &lt;- parse_url(&quot;http://date.nager.at&quot;)
  url$path &lt;- paste0(&quot;api/v1/get/&quot;, country_code, &quot;/&quot;, year)
  base_url &lt;- build_url(url)
  
  # Get content from the site
  content_json &lt;- content(GET(base_url))
  
  # Extract only relevant fields
  df &lt;- map_df(content_json, extract, c(&quot;countryCode&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;date&quot;))
  df
}</code></pre>
<p>And the output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_holidays(country_code = &quot;AT&quot;, year = 2019)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 13 x 3

<p>And for several years:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>years &lt;- c(&quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2017&quot;, &quot;2018&quot;, &quot;2019&quot;)
map_df(years, function(x) get_holidays(&quot;AT&quot;, x))</code></pre>

<p>After all, I still find two main drawbacks.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I haven’t analyzed the data quality and I don’t know exactly if someone is maintaining this website.</li>
<li>It’d be interesting to include regional and local holidays and, in addition, a label with relevant days (Black Friday, for example).</li>
</ol>
<p>Does anyone have a better approach?</p>
