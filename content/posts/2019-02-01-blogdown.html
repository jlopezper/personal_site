<p>The first thing I’d recommend to anyone who wants to build a website from R using <code>blogdown</code> is to read the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">book</a> of the author of this package, Yihui Xie.</p>
<p>Therefore, this post isn’t intended to be a guide on how to make your own website but a way to tell my experience through the process. The details of what each folder should contain within the project are fully and very well explained on the book linked above.</p>
<p>Before creating any R project, you obviously must install the <code>blogdown</code> package and not just for using the functions this package provides but also for creating the R project from RStudio. Once installed with <code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)</code> you can create the project in RStudio by clicking at File –&gt; New Project. Then you will find the following menu:</p>
