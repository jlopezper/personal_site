      <description>I’ve been recently working on a time series model to which I wanted to include the public holidays of Spain and Portugal. After trying different approaches I decided to move forward with prophet which, by the way, I strongly recommend it.
But this post comes to my mind because I’d like to tell some options we have to get the public holidays by country. I don’t want to go into details about the specificities of what a public holidays mean (regional or local ones are excluded in this analysis, for example).</description>
